2) The "Shadowban" Risk Rater

Intersection: AI + Indie Hacking

Concept: Since you are already building ShillGuard, create a lightweight web version. Users paste their Reddit post facebook group post or cold email draft and the AI gives a percentage probability of it being flagged as spam.

Why it goes viral: It solves an immediate pain point for every indie hacker. It acts as a perfect "side door" lead magnet for your full extension.

Domain Authority Play: When people ask "Why was my post removed?" on forums, you can answer with a link to this checker on your site

it should have the same ui and ux as the main site https://shillguardapp.com and also link to this as well 
it is important that this free web tool is lighweight and not computationally expensive (ideally not using llm's) as it will likely have a lot of traffic.
